# Predicting Solar Wind Conditions with Machine Learning â€“ Team Helios
## Arizona State University - Spring 2020

### Project Description: Our project involves using Machine Learning to predict solar wind conditions at various points in the solar system.


## Linear Regression Model 
The Linear regression model is located in basicmodel folder 
In order to run this model you need to install Python 3.5 >=
Thereafter, you need to install the following packages
pandas
numpy
sklearn.linear_model
sklearn.model_selection
sklearn.metrics import
matplotlib.pyplot
scipy
statsmodels.api
statsmodels.formula.api
seaborn
datetime
Once you have installed the packages you can run the model which ends in ipynb on jupyter notebook  or .py model on python editor. 
The model is well commented so follow the instruction in the model section for more details.

## Data Processing
Most of the data processing files will work as is, however, some of the paths might have changed, if a file is not in the root folder, check in the CSV files folder. Additionally, all of the most up-to date data files should be in the root folder. These files are as follows: Artemis1YearRedux, Artemis1Year2Redux, Pioneer2Redux, Pioneer3Redux, Pioneer1Year, Pioneer1Year2. The last two Pioneer files use the point-by-point timeshift, but were only used for comparison to the other two files. To run the Jupyter Notebook files, you will need pandas, numpy, datetime, matplotlib, etc. 


#### Side Note
Also, we experimented with Logistic Regression and you can find that model in the basicModel folder.
